Be sure to include the package-lock.json and package.json files, or just use npx create-react-app@5 project-name and copy the App.js file. If using the create-react-app method, get rid of the reportWebVitals script.

This is just a simple practice project where I used data from several save files during my playthrough of Ys I&II Chronicles+ on the Nightmare Difficulty. I had save files that were either safety saves, or saved before boss fights, hence the multitude of them, and some being relatively similar.

You can add data by following the template in the savefiles array and just adding in Test Data. This project doesn't use data validation, but the final save slot I included has my end game stats after defeating the final boss.
